#  Fiberal federated learning use cases
There we are talking about the activities in one project. Use has to choose one of the following use cause for project initialization.

##  Single client module
This can be used for algorithmus testing in single machine.
### Function parts
- A
- B
- C
- D
- E
- F
- J
  
##  Multiple client modules
this is for centerilized Cross-Silo learning architecture. All users start with the same ONNX file and develop independently.
### Function parts
- A
- B
- C
- D
- E
- F
- J
  

##  Single server module
This can be used for hosting the well-trained ONNX file, like ONNX Zoo.
### Function parts
- C



## Multiple server modules
Multiple single server module for different ONNX version. This is a kind of pure P2P decenterlized learning architecture.
### Function parts
- C



##  Single client module and agency module
For modul testing, but not sharing, this is Cross-Silo learning architecture.  User deploy this system and run it locally.
### Function parts
- All



##  Multiple client module and agency module
Hyper-federated learning architecture. How the users trust ONNX file is totally free. This can build all possibilities.
### Function parts
- All
