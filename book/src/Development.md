# RestAPI or WebAssembly 

As the fundamental question of this project, we have to decide that how to communicate between different module, i.e., interface, client and server. Client has to send data to postgressql for authentication, but there is I have to switch from Webassembly to RestAPI. Because Webassembly does NOT support sending postgressql request, in our case, with sqlx.

## interface module

## client module



## server module
