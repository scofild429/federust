# Project descripation
This project is trying to implement the interface, client and server module in one rust project. It will be hard to render a nice user graphical interface, but all functions are combined together, no HTTP requests between different module are needed.

## Deployment
```sh 
cargo build
```
Project will be compiled into binary file, just execute it. Be careful to add --release for better performance.
