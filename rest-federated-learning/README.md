# Project descripation
This project is trying to implement the client and server module in a separated rust project, and offer all their functions through HTTP request as API endpoints. So we can send the HTTP requests with Restful style API from interface module.

## Deployment
```sh 
cargo build
```
Project will be compiled into binary file, just execute it. Be careful to add --release for better performance.
